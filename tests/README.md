# BookBuddy Test Suite

This directory contains tests for the BookBuddy Flask application. The tests are organized into subdirectories based on component types.

## Test Structure

- **forms/** - Tests for form validation
- **models/** - Tests for database models and database utilities
- **recommendation/** - Tests for the book recommendation system
- **utils/** - Tests for application configuration and initialization

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

To run tests with verbose output:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

To run tests for a specific module:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/recommendation/test_recommendation.py
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=Bookbuddy_app
```

## Test Dependencies

The test suite requires the following dependencies, which can be installed using the provided `requirements-test.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

## Implemented Tests

### Forms Tests
- Login form validation
- Signup form validation

### Model Tests
- Database existence verification
- Database table structure verification
- User model validation
- Record counting functionality

### Recommendation Tests
- BookRecommender initialization

### Utility Tests
- Application configuration
- Google Books API key configuration
- Application factory functionality
- Blueprint registration
- Extension initialization
- Database table creation
- User loader registration

## Mocking Strategy

The tests utilize extensive mocking to avoid external dependencies:

1. **Database Mocking**: Using SQLAlchemy in-memory SQLite databases for testing without requiring a real database
2. **Flask App Mocking**: Custom TestApp and MockFlask implementations for app initialization tests
3. **Module Mocking**: Mocking external libraries like sklearn for recommendation testing
4. **Environment Variable Mocking**: Mocking os.getenv to provide test configurations
5. **Blueprint Mocking**: Using MockBlueprint to test route registration

## Fixed Issues

The following issues were fixed in the test suite:

1. **check_database.py Tests**:
   - Fixed database path checking by mocking `os.path.exists`
   - Improved assertion conditions to handle different output formats

2. **Recommendation.py Tests**:
   - Created comprehensive mocks for the `BookRecommender` class
   - Fixed application context issues by using the `test_app` fixture
   - Properly mocked the entire `Recommendation` module to avoid import errors
   - Implemented tests for key recommendation functions

3. **__init__.py Tests**:
   - Created a custom `MockFlask` class with proper configuration handling
   - Added proper mocking for environment variables
   - Fixed Flask configuration issues with `FlaskConfig` class
   - Properly mocked blueprint registration

## Current Coverage

Current test coverage is approximately 30%, with the highest coverage in:
- `__init__.py` (96%)
- `models.py` (94%)
- `config.py` (91%)
- `check_database.py` (85%)

Areas needing more test coverage:
- `Recommendation.py` (0%)
- `app.py` (21%)
- `routes/` (24-25%)
