# BookBuddy Website Code Repository

This repository contains the code for the BookBuddy website.

We are using **Flask** for our backend and **SQLAlchemy** for our database.

## Project Overview
BookBuddy is a web application that recommends books to users based on their preferences and reading history. The platform integrates with external APIs like Google Books and leverages AI algorithms to generate personalized book suggestions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite)
- **API Integration**: Google Books API, Goodreads API
- **AI Recommendation Engine**:  TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-repository/bookbuddy.git](https://github.com/DTM-software-engineering-BOOKBUDDY-AI/code-rep-for-bookbuddy.git)

# BookBuddy Database Structure

Our database is like a digital filing cabinet with four main sections (tables), each storing specific information:

## 1. User Table üìù
Stores information about each user, like a detailed user profile card:
- **ID**: A unique number for each user (like a library card number)
- **Basic Info**:
  - Email address
  - Username
  - Password (stored securely)
  - When they joined
- **Profile Info**:
  - Profile picture link
  - Bio (their description)
  - Gender
  - Birthday
  - Phone number
  - Preferred language
  - Privacy setting (public/private)
- **Social Lists**:
  - Friends list
  - Blocked users list
  - Hidden users list

## 2. UserPreferences Table üéØ
Keeps track of what each user likes and how they want to use the app:
- **ID**: Unique number for each preference set
- **User ID**: Links back to the user
- **Reading Preferences**:
  - Favorite book types (genres)
  - Preferred reading language
  - Yearly reading goal
- **Settings**:
  - Email notification preferences

## 3. ReadingList Table üìö
Works like a reading diary, tracking books users are reading:
- **ID**: Unique number for each entry
- **User ID**: Who's reading
- **Book ID**: Which book
- **Reading Status**: Want to read/Reading/Finished
- **Progress**: How far along (0-100%)
- **Dates**: When started and finished

## 4. Book Table üìñ
Contains information about each book:
- **ID**: Unique number for each book
- **Basic Info**:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Cover image link
  - Genre
  - Language
  - Publication year
- **Details**:
  - Summary/Description

### How Tables Connect üîó
Think of these tables like different sections of a library that reference each other:
- Each User can have one set of UserPreferences
- Users can have many books in their ReadingList
- Each book can be in many users' ReadingLists

This structure helps us:
1. Keep track of who's reading what
2. Make personalized book recommendations
3. Manage user profiles and preferences
4. Track reading progress and history
